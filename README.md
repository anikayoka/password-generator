# Password Generator

## Purpose
To generate a random password, using numeric, special, upper & lowercase characters

## Built With
* JavaScript

## Issues
* I deleted original repository as I was having trouble deploying my site (and thought it was my only recourse). Unfortunately all original commits were also deleted. 

* In retrospect I did not have to delete te file, I simply had to make adjustments to my HTML document.

* I have learnt from my mistakes, for the future.
